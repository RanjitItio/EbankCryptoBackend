print("Here is a reel script about not criticizing, condemning or complaining:")

print("Hey friends! I wanted to share something I've been thinking about lately.") 

print("It's so easy to criticize or complain about things we don't like.")

print("But that negativity doesn't really help anyone. It just brings us down.")

print("Instead, I'm trying to focus on the good. Find the positives, even in difficult situations.")  

print("And when I see something wrong, not judge it, but think about how I can help make it better.")

print("This mindset takes practice, but it makes such a difference in how I feel and relate to others.")

print("So next time you're tempted to condemn, criticize or complain, try to pause. And redirect that energy into something more constructive.") 

print("Our words have power. Let's use them to lift each other up.")

print("Thanks for listening. Wishing you all a beautiful day!")
